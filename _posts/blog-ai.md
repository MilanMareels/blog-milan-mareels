Hey everyone,

Recently, I have been hearing that AI will replace programmers. Developers will become obsolete in the near future, and AI will do everything better or so people say.

But the truth is, any person who has been involved in a real, large-scale software project knows that it is not that straightforward. I am talking here from my personal experience. Yes, I am still a software development student and the founder of **Lannie**, a company where I build websites for businesses, but I see what AI is capable of (and what it is not) every single day.

## The Complexity Trap

AI is able to write code, and at times, even better than I could. However, when the project gets complicated for example, with dozens of files, layers, dependencies, and tests the AI loses its way very quickly.

**AI does not comprehend the overall picture or the logic behind the design choices.**

AI can put together a UI, but most of the time, it is not balanced, or there is no logic behind it. It can generate tests, but this does not imply that they are good ones. Good tests are more than just "check if it works." It is all about thinking in advance and taking into consideration scenarios such as:

- Edge cases
- User behavior
- Performance optimization

AI does not really _think_ like humans do. It works on patterns and predictions, but it does not reason, plan, or understand the purpose of the code. AI verifies what you ask it to verify, not what you fail to see. And that is the difference between testing and understanding.

## The Outsider's Perspective

Still, the idea that AI will replace programmers is something I keep hearing. People in IT who have never written a single line of code, or people who are completely out of the field, are those who mostly say that.

They fail to realize that programming is a lot more than just printing “Hello, World!” or changing the color of a button on a website. **Programming is mainly about finding the solutions to problems, creating the systems, and grasping how everything is connected.**

## AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch

I also employ AI technology, though not in a manner whereby it does my work for me. Rather, I use it as a tool of learning. Sometimes it even turns out to be a better teacher than a human because it can very quickly demonstrate to me why a thing works or does not work.

However, there are times when AI can divert your attention from the simplest or most obvious solution. It is always beneficial to go through the documentation on your own, as that is where true understanding is derived from.

## Real Programmers vs. Users

The fact is that people who fully depend on AI to write their code are not real programmers. They are merely users.

I witness such people on a daily basis: they use AI to generate code, then they copy and paste it. When you ask them to explain what it is that they have done, they can neither describe the simplest part of it nor give you any logical explanation. They do not grasp the logic, the structure, or the reasoning behind the code; they just execute it and hope it works.

A **real programmer** is one who thinks, understands, and creates with a specific intent. This is what distinguishes a good programmer from a normal one.

## The Future of Coding

So, do I believe AI will replace programmers, me included?

**The answer is no.**

Not because I am scared of losing my job or because AI is becoming better at generating code, but because programming is both my passion and my future. Constructing software that users can trust requires more than just writing code that compiles. It requires people who know:

- Architecture
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- The long-term vision of a project

It's about creating frameworks, handling intricate problems, and taking decisions that balance features, effectiveness, and sustainability. That kind of insight, accountability, and belonging is something an AI model is far from being able to imitate.

I am not trying to start a debate or argue with anyone. I am merely stating my experience and sharing my opinion about AI.
